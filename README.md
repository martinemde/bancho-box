## Technology Stack

This application is built with [SvelteKit](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit) and styled with [Skeleton UI](https://skeleton.dev) for a modern, accessible user experience.

## Development

### Prerequisites

Install dependencies:

```sh
npm install
```

### Data Processing

The application processes CSV data files into optimized JSON bundles. Before running the development server, you need to build the data:

```sh
npm run build:data
```

This command imports and pre-computes data from CSV files in the `data/` directory, creating optimized JSON files in `src/lib/data/`.

### Running the Development Server

Start the development server (this automatically runs `build:data` first):

```sh
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

### Building for Production

To create a production version of the app:

```sh
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

## Project Structure

- `data/` - CSV files containing dishes, ingredients, parties, and relationships
- `scripts/build-database.ts` - Data processing script that converts CSV to JSON
- `src/lib/data/` - Generated JSON data files (created by `build:data`)
- `src/routes/` - SvelteKit application pages and components
